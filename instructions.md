<p>There are four levels of increasing complexity for this example:
<ol>
<li> <b>Compare</b> the provided final output plot
   mass4l_combine.pdf
   or
   mass4l_combine.png
   to  <a href=\"https://inspirehep.net/record/1124338/files/H4l_mass_v3.png\">the published one</a>,
   keeping in mind the caveats mentioned in this record. </li>
<li><b>Reproduce</b> the final output plot from the predefined histogram files
   using a root macro
   (~few minutes - ~few hours, depending on setup and proficiency) </li>
<ul>
  <li>See detailed instructions in instructions.txt in this record.</li>
  <li>The root files are available in a separate  <a href=\"/record/FIXME\">record</a> and the necessary root macros are attached to this record.</li>
</ul>
<li>   <b>Produce</b> a root data input file from original data and MC files for one
   Higgs signal candidate and for the simulated Higgs signal with reduced
   statistics (for speed reasons) and reproduce the final output plot
   containing your own input using a root macro
   (~few minutes to ~1 hour if Virtual machine is already installed,
     depending on internet connection and computer performance, up to
     ~few hours otherwise) </li>
   <ul>
  <li>See detailed instructions in instructions.txt in this record.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Reproduce the full example analysis
   (up to ~1 month or more on single CPU with fast internet connection,
    depending on internet connection speed and computer performance) </li>
<ul>
  <li>See detailed instructions in instructions.txt in this record.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
